# TTE_ONTARGET
Programming code and code lists used for project using the ONTARGET trial to inform design and benchmark findings before extending results to explore treatment heterogeneity by ethnicity using CPRD Aurum-linked data

Study applies reference trial emulation methods to (1) emulate the design of and; (2) benchmark findings against an existing RCT (ONTARGET) before extending analysis to explore treatment effect heterogeneity by ethnicity. Explores treatment effects of ARB vs ACEi among an ONTARGET-eligible cohort in CPRD Aurum-linked data.

Code lists include product codes used to define exposure of ARB of ACEi. ICD10, OPCS and medcodes used to emulate the inclusion and exclusion criteria from the ONTARGET trial using CPRD-linked data and codes used to define outcomes.

Do-files include data management files, analysis files and do-files used to build propensity score models.
